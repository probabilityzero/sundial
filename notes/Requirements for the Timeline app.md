> see i want to create an app with 2 main feature of it, first the app will have the to-do list to it which i call study sessions where we will have a bullet list kind of goals to add for that session. second is there will be a button where it starts monitoring the time you are studying and it gives a flowing desing to the website when you are studying that can be achihved, but it doesnt just record when you start studying and end studying it also analyis and give a lot of information that helps us see our daily time we studies, the average and the time we study on the map and also for what we studies since we will have an option to add and update tags when we are studing, tag could be made as much we want to but it will keep record when we are going to specify, it will also need auth if we are using databases. so its a big big work, the overall theme should be very minimal and even more integration like that of discord or telegram or even in other apps like obsidian , or google calender to get the tasks assigned, that when we join the call it automatically starts the study timer record. we could also see the app in other places and edit it with both that can be done later but it should be so modular to support all that. but in the end the funtionality it should have is you go to the app (web or otherwise) you are greeted in a way you lock in it, you login if you havent, in the app you see very few features in your eyes. like in phon there is a menu button where you can access your profile page, the calender page, the time analysis page,, themes and settings where you can cahnge account settings and so on. on the main page you you have a list of things to do, the titled is called morning/midnight/evening session based on the time or you can change it by tapping on it, i dont know wher ebut ther eshould be a button to signify you are starting study, and i dont know where but there should be a button to add tag for what you are a doing, and the study session should be recorded while an option to pause which would be called break wihtout breaking the study session, and when we done a task it adds to the study session , so maybe the study sessions will have their own databases, the to-do list will have own daatbase , the user database, there wont be much button on the to-do thing but on hover we will get a button to delete or transfer the task to other day.

This is an ambitious project, but letâ€™s break it down into **manageable components** and design a **scalable architecture** using modern tools. Below is a detailed plan, tech stack recommendations, and code snippets to get you started.

### **Tech Stack**
| Component               | Tools                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**            | React.js (Next.js for SSR) or SvelteKit (minimalist, fast)                               |
| **Backend**             | Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL + Realtime) + Node.js/Vercel Edge Functions for integrations |
| **Analytics**           | PostgreSQL (time-series data) + Cube.js (analytics API)                                  |
| **Design**              | Tailwind CSS (minimal) + Framer Motion (animations)                                      |
| **Integrations**        | Discord/Telegram bots (Node.js), Google Calendar API                                     |
| **Deployment**          | Vercel (frontend + serverless) + Supabase (backend)                                      |

### **Core Features & Implementation**
Letâ€™s split the app into **3 modules** for clarity:

#### **1. Authentication & User Management**
- **Tools**: Supabase Auth (free tier).
- **Implementation**:
  - Sign-in with Google/GitHub/Email.
  - Store user profiles in `users` table (Supabase PostgreSQL).
  - Session management with JWT tokens.

#### **2. Study Sessions & Todo Lists**
- **Database Schema**:
  ```sql
  -- Users
  CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID REFERENCES auth.users PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT,
    timezone TEXT DEFAULT 'UTC'
  );

  -- Study Sessions (time tracking)
  CREATE TABLE study_sessions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    start_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    end_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
    duration INTERVAL,
    tags TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}', -- Array of tags (e.g., {"math", "python"})
    is_break BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
  );

  -- Todos
  CREATE TABLE todos (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    session_type TEXT CHECK (session_type IN ('morning', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'custom')),
    content TEXT,
    is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
  );
  ```

#### **3. Time Tracking & Analytics**
- **Tools**: PostgreSQL window functions + Cube.js (for aggregations).
- **Key Features**:
  - Start/Stop/Pause timer (handled via buttons).
  - Real-time updates using Supabase Realtime.
  - Tags added dynamically during study sessions.
  - Daily/Weekly/Monthly heatmaps (like GitHub contributions).

---

### **Frontend Design (Minimalist)**
#### **UI Structure**:
1. **Main Page** (`/`):
   - Current session timer (floating button or top bar).
   - Todo list for todayâ€™s sessions (collapsible sections for morning/evening).
   - Button to add tags dynamically (e.g., "Add Tag" â†’ input field appears).
2. **Analytics Page** (`/analytics`):
   - Heatmap calendar (daily study time).
   - Pie charts (tag distribution), line graphs (weekly averages).
3. **Settings** (`/settings`):
   - Integrations (Discord/Google Calendar linking).
   - Theme toggles (light/dark mode).

#### **Example Component (Timer)**
```tsx
// Timer component (React)
function Timer() {
  const [isStudying, setIsStudying] = useState(false);
  const [startTime, setStartTime] = useState<Date | null>(null);
  const [tags, setTags] = useState<string[]>([]);

  const startStudy = async () => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('study_sessions')
      .insert([{ start_time: new Date(), user_id: currentUser.id }])
      .select();
    if (data) setIsStudying(true);
  };

  const addTag = async (tag: string) => {
    await supabase
      .from('study_sessions')
      .update({ tags: [...tags, tag] })
      .eq('id', currentSessionId);
  };

  return (
    <div className="fixed bottom-4 right-4 bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
      {isStudying ? (
        <div>
          <button onClick={stopStudy}>Stop</button>
          <input 
            type="text" 
            placeholder="Add tag..." 
            onBlur={(e) => addTag(e.target.value)}
          />
        </div>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={startStudy}>Start Studying</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### **Integrations**
#### **Discord/Telegram Bots**
- **Discord Bot** (Node.js):
  - Listen for `/start_study` command â†’ triggers `startStudy()` via API.
  - Use `discord.js` library.
- **Google Calendar Sync**:
  - OAuth2 flow to fetch scheduled tasks.
  - Automatically create todos from calendar events.

#### **Obsidian Integration**
- Embed app via `<iframe src="https://your-app.vercel.app/embed">`.
- Use Obsidianâ€™s **Custom Frames** plugin for seamless integration.

---

### **Deployment Flow**
4. **Supabase Setup**:
   - Create tables and enable Auth/Realtime.
   - Generate API keys for integrations.
5. **Frontend (Vercel)**:
   - Deploy Next.js/SvelteKit app with `vercel deploy`.
   - Set environment variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
6. **Analytics**:
   - Deploy Cube.js on a free-tier cloud service (e.g., Railway.app).

---

### **Code Structure**
```
src/
â”œâ”€ components/     # Reusable UI (Timer, TodoItem)
â”œâ”€ lib/            # Supabase client, analytics helpers
â”œâ”€ pages/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.tsx    # Main page (Todos + Timer)
â”‚  â”œâ”€ analytics.tsx
â”‚  â”œâ”€ settings.tsx
â”œâ”€ styles/         # Tailwind config
```

---

### **Challenges & Solutions**
7. **Real-Time Sync**:
   - Use Supabase Realtime to update todos/timers across devices instantly.
8. **Time Zone Handling**:
   - Store user timezone in `users` table and convert dates on the frontend.
9. **Performance**:
   - Use PostgreSQL indexing for `study_sessions(date)` and `todos(user_id)`.
10. **Security**:
   - Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase to restrict data access by `user_id`.

---

### **Roadmap**
11. **Phase 1**: Core Todo + Timer (2 weeks).
12. **Phase 2**: Auth + Analytics (1 week).
13. **Phase 3**: Integrations (Discord/Google Calendar) + Obsidian iframe (2 weeks).
